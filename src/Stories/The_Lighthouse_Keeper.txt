The Lighthouse Keeper
When the automation notice arrived, Henrik folded it carefully and placed it beneath the brass compass on his desk. The letter was polite. The sea would no longer require him.

For thirty-two years he had risen before dawn, climbed the spiral steps, and polished the lens until it scattered the sunrise into prisms across the stone walls. Ships no longer depended on the lighthouse; satellites and software traced safer paths. The ministry thanked him for his service.

The final night he kept the lamp burning anyway.

Fog rolled in thick and directionless. The horn moaned like a tired animal. Henrik brewed coffee strong enough to stain memory itself and listened to the waves argue with the rocks.

Near midnight he thought he saw a flicker beyond the shoals. Not a ship — too small. A rowboat, perhaps. Or a trick of light against fog. Protocol no longer applied. His employment had ended at sunset.

He lit the lamp to full brightness.

The beam cut through the mist like a steady thought. Minutes passed. The flicker steadied, angled, then disappeared behind the safer channel markers.

Henrik allowed himself a quiet smile.

In the morning he locked the tower and handed over the keys. The young technician who replaced him carried a tablet instead of oil. She thanked him for maintaining “legacy infrastructure.”

Henrik did not mind the phrase. That night, at home inland, he woke before dawn anyway. Somewhere beyond the hills, a light he no longer tended turned on automatically. He hoped it still frightened the fog.
