Last Bus Home
The bus station smelled of diesel and burnt coffee.

Jonas stared at the departure board. His hometown was only three hours away, but he had avoided the route for a decade.

His mother’s voicemail had been brief: “Your father’s tools are still in the shed.”

That was all.

He boarded anyway.

Fields blurred past the window. He remembered fixing fence posts with his father, both pretending not to notice how quickly silence could become distance.

The house looked smaller. The shed door stuck halfway, just as it used to.

Inside, the tools hung in careful rows. His father’s handwriting labeled each pegboard hook. A space near the center remained empty.

Jonas knew what belonged there: the hammer he’d taken the night he left after their argument. He had meant to return it.

He retrieved it from his backpack.

The wood handle bore a crack from years of use. He placed it back on its hook.

Outside, wind moved through tall grass. Nothing magical happened. No voice forgave him. No revelation rewrote the past.

But when he locked the shed, the house felt less accusatory.

At the bus station that evening, Jonas bought two coffees. He left one on the bench beside him, steam rising into the cooling air.

Some apologies were conversations you finished alone.
