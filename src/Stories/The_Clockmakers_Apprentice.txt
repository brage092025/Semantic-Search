The Clockmaker's Apprentice
Prague, 1891.

Tomas swept brass filings from the workshop floor while Master Novak adjusted the cathedral clock’s escapement mechanism.

“Time,” Novak declared, “is a promise we make to strangers.”

Tomas preferred gears to philosophy.

One evening a woman arrived carrying a pocket watch that refused to tick. “It stopped,” she whispered, “at the moment my brother boarded a ship for America.”

Novak examined the watch. “Nothing is broken,” he said.

“Then why won’t it move?”

He handed it to Tomas. The balance wheel trembled but did not commit.

“Fear,” Novak murmured.

Tomas rolled his eyes — until he noticed salt residue beneath the casing hinge. Sea air.

He disassembled the watch carefully. A grain of sand lodged between teeth no wider than a whisper.

He removed it.

The watch resumed ticking, soft and steady.

The woman wept with relief.

After she left, Tomas asked, “Was it really fear?”

Novak smiled. “Every mechanism has a story. People prefer poetry to sand.”

Years later, when Tomas kept the shop alone, he told apprentices the same thing — though he always checked for sand first.
