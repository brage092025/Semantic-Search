The Inheritance
The envelope arrived without a return address. Inside was a single key and a train ticket to a town Nora had left twenty years ago.

The note read: You forgot something.

She hadn’t.

The house stood at the end of a gravel road, paint surrendering to weather. It had belonged to her aunt Elise, who died the summer Nora turned fifteen — officially an accident, unofficially a scandal no one explained.

The key fit the cellar door.

Inside, dust clung to shelves of canning jars and yellowed newspapers. At the far wall stood a locked cabinet Nora did not remember.

The second key lay taped beneath the first.

Inside the cabinet was not money, nor jewels, but ledgers. Names, dates, payments. Her aunt had kept records of loans — quiet ones — to nearly everyone in town. Interest marked as “favors.”

The final entry bore Nora’s name.

Loan: bus ticket out. Repayment due: return when ready.

A creak echoed above. Nora stepped outside to find half the town gathered near the fence, watching.

Old Mr. Halvorsen removed his cap. “She said you’d come back,” he murmured.

“For what?” Nora asked.

He gestured toward the sagging roof, the cracked windows, the empty porch. “To decide what we owe.”

The inheritance was not property. It was leverage.

Nora looked at the house, at the waiting faces, at the years she had spent running from whispers.

“You owe her honesty,” she said. “And you owe each other better.”

The crowd shifted uneasily.

Nora pocketed the ledgers. Some debts, she decided, would never be collected.
