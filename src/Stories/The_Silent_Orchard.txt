The Silent Orchard,Fantasy
After the Collapse, the trees stopped flowering.

No one understood why. Soil tests revealed nothing unusual. Bees vanished. Seasons blurred.

Mara tended the orchard anyway.

Each morning she brushed dust from branches and spoke to them as if language could coax biology.

Other survivors bartered canned goods and batteries. Mara traded cuttings — dormant sticks that promised nothing.

One day a boy arrived carrying a jar with a single bee inside.

“I found it in the subway tunnels,” he said.

The bee moved sluggishly, tapping glass with fragile insistence.

Mara released it among the barren trees.

For days, nothing changed.

Then one branch unfurled a hesitant bloom.

The settlement gathered in disbelief. One flower was not food. It was not survival.

But it was direction.

They built small shelters for insects. Planted wildflowers between rows. Reduced generator noise during daylight hours.

The following spring, three trees bloomed.

Hope, Mara realized, propagated like grafting — fragile, deliberate, dependent on care.

The orchard was still mostly silent.

But it was no longer mute.
