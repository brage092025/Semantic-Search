A Recipe For Rain
Grandmother claimed she could cook the weather.

On dry summer days she mixed flour, salt, and a pinch of something she refused to name. She kneaded the dough while humming low, thunderous notes.

By evening, clouds gathered.

As a child, Lina believed without question. As a meteorology student, she called it coincidence.

When drought struck their valley for the third straight year, Lina returned home armed with data models and skepticism.

Grandmother stood at the counter, hands dusted white.

“You’ve come to help?” she asked.

“To measure,” Lina replied.

They baked together. Lina recorded humidity, pressure, wind speed. The air remained stubbornly clear.

Grandmother shaped the dough into small crescents. “It isn’t the ingredients,” she said. “It’s the remembering.”

“Remembering what?”

“That we belong to the sky as much as it belongs to us.”

They placed the bread in the oven.

Hours later, still no clouds.

Lina felt vindicated — and strangely disappointed.

Then a breeze shifted through the open window, cool and damp. Not from above, but from the riverbed long thought dry.

Rain began upstream, fed by snowmelt Lina’s models hadn’t accounted for.

It reached the valley by morning.

Grandmother sliced the bread and handed Lina a piece. “Science,” she said approvingly, “is another kind of recipe.”

Lina tasted salt and something like forgiveness.
