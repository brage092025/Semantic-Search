Commander Asha Verma had always trusted physics more than people.

The signal from Kepler-442b broke that habit.

It wasn’t language exactly. It was a pattern embedded in stellar radiation — a modulation so subtle it hid inside background noise. Most of the crew believed it was a sensor glitch.

Asha believed in anomalies.

They adjusted orbit to triangulate the source. The planet below was cloud-swaddled and ocean-heavy. No cities. No heat signatures. Nothing that should broadcast intention.

When they decoded the pattern, it resolved into a three-dimensional map — not of space, but of time. A sequence of gravitational fluctuations plotted centuries into the future.

The map showed their ship.

It showed the moment their reactor would fail during atmospheric descent.

Silence swallowed the bridge.

“It’s a warning,” said Malik, the youngest engineer. “Or a prediction.”

“Or a memory,” Asha said.

The map updated as they argued. Every hypothetical maneuver they simulated appeared seconds later inside the signal, branching like coral.

The planet was not predicting them.

It was observing them think.

Asha shut down the descent program. “We don’t land,” she said.

The map flickered. The catastrophic branch faded. New paths formed — none ending in fire.

Far below, the ocean clouds churned.

For the first time in her career, Asha addressed something she could not see. “Message received.”

The signal smoothed into quiet stellar static.

Physics, she decided, was only lonely when you believed you were the only one speaking it.
