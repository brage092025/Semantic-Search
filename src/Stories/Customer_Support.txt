The afterlife had a ticketing system.

“Next,” called the angel at Desk 4, adjusting a headset that glowed faintly.

Martin approached clutching a numbered slip. “I believe there’s been a mistake.”

The angel typed. “Cause of death: choking on a kale chip.”

“That can’t be right. I don’t even like kale.”

The angel swiveled the monitor. There was Martin, heroic in intent, attempting to impress a date with healthy snacking.

Martin squinted. “In my defense, it was aggressively textured.”

“Appeal process is straightforward,” the angel said. “Form B-17, existential reconsideration.”

Martin glanced around. Harps tuned in the distance. Someone argued about reincarnation settings.

“What are my options?”

“Heaven, standard package. Rebirth, randomized. Or we can send you back five minutes before the incident.”

Martin brightened. “I’ll choose the five minutes.”

“Very well,” the angel said. “But statistically, you will attempt the kale again.”

Martin hesitated. “Is there a version where I order fries?”

The angel checked. “That timeline exists, but you spill ketchup on your shirt and the date leaves unimpressed.”

Martin sighed. “Heaven, then.”

The angel stamped his file. “Wise choice. We have excellent fries.”
